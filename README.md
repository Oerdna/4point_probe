# 4point_probe
Four point probe is used to measure resistive properties of semiconductor wafers and thin films [[1](https://www.pveducation.org/pvcdrom/characterisation/four-point-probe-resistivity-measurements)].

In this case are studing the I - V characteristic of an element depending on the temperature of the sample. It is important to understand the I â€“ V characteristic near the metal-insulator phase transition (MIT), which is about 68 degrees Celsius. You must understand that the ultimate goal is to stabilize the temperature to a specific value.
